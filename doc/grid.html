    <div class="texto"><p> <b>Jungwon</b>  is a South Korean singer who was born on February 9, 2004, He attended Namgang High School.</p> <p>In 2020, he was one of the contestants in the reality survival TV show “I-LAND,” and placed first in the final standings.</p> <p>  Later the same year, he debuted with the contestants who placed 2-7 in the all-male K-pop group ENHYPEN</p>
       <p> <b><i>How does it feel to finally debut?</i></b> </p> 
       <p> <b>JUNGWON:</b>  We’re on music shows, we’re doing a lot of promotional activities, our videos are on YouTube and social media, and even MR removed videos are being uploaded.</p> <p>These videos used to feature other idol groups, but now that I see our faces in them, the fact that we have debuted is slowly sinking in.</p> 
       <p> <b><i> It must have been difficult getting ready for your debut right after I-LAND ended.</i></b></p> 
       <p> <b>JUNGWON:</b>  We didn’t have much time until our debut. So our biggest priority was to perfect our debut performance, and once it was ready, we tried hard to become a tight-knit team.</p> <p>Trainees usually spend years together before they debut, but it’s been less than a year since we became a team.</p> 
       <p> <i> <b>You must have put in a lot of effort.</b></i> </p> 
       <p> <b>JUNGWON:</b> We practiced “Given-Taken” so much. (laughs) We did practice “Let Me In (20 CUBE)” a lot too, but not as much as “Given-Taken.”</p>
       <p><i><b>Which performance did you particularly enjoy or focus on at the DEBUT SHOW?</b></p></i> 
       <p><b>JUNGWON:</b> “Let Me In (20 CUBE)” is a cheerful song, and it has a lot of jumps in the choreography, so we had a lot of fun performing it.</p>
